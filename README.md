## Hw4 requirements to get an 'A'

-Things that Karplus wrote in the assignment are in " "

-Things that Darrin wrote are not in " ", but aim to clarify what
 Karplus wrote

### Task list for Assignment 4, based on order of appearance on his site

1. "You will build stochastic models of these sequences as zero-order
and first-order Markov chains, and measure the information gain of the
first-order model over the zero-order model."

2. "so that 'A' and 'a' both stand for alanine." Make the sequences
all uppercase to avoid this problem.
    - [X] DTS seq.upper() in count_kmers() method

3. "You will do 2-fold cross-validation (training on each of the set
and testing on the other)." This is in reference to mark_f14_1.seqs
and mark_f14_2.seqs

4. Access the two above files using
"/soe/karplus/.html/bme205/f14/markov_files/ so that you don't need to
make your own copies.  (Note: the "f14" is correct---I'm reusing the
files from last year.)"
