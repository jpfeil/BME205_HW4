Hw4 requirements to get an 'A'

-Things that Karplus wrote in the assignment are in " "
-Things that Darrin wrote are not in " ", but aim to clarify what
 Karplus wrote
 
-[ ] "You will build stochastic models of these sequences as zero-order
    and first-order Markov chains, and measure the information gain of the
    first-order model over the zero-order model." ONLY CHECK THIS WHEN
    100% COMPLETE.

-[X] "so that 'A' and 'a' both stand for alanine." Make the sequences
    all uppercase to avoid this problem.
    DTS seq.upper() in count_kmers() method

-[ ] "You will do 2-fold cross-validation (training on each of the sets
    and testing on the other)." This is in reference to
    mark_f14_1.seqs and mark_f14_2.seqs

-[ ] Access the two above files using
    "/soe/karplus/.html/bme205/f14/markov_files/ so that you don't need to
    make your own copies.  (Note: the "f14" is correct---I'm reusing
    the files from last year.)"
